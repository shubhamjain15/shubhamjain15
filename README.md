### Hi there! 👋

I'm Shubham Jain, a passionate water resources engineer with a PhD from Texas A&M University in Water Management and Hydrological Science. My research focuses on applying machine learning models to solve complex hydrology problems. 

💻 **Machine Learning Enthusiast** - I am deeply interested in the application of machine learning techniques to earth system science. I believe that AI can revolutionize how we manage and protect our precious water resources.

🔬 **Research Focus** - My research areas include rainfall-runoff modeling, flood prediction, and water quality assessment. I'm committed to advancing our knowledge in these critical areas.

🤝 **Collaboration** - I'm always open to collaborating on projects related to large-sample hydrological modeling. If you're working on similar topics or have ideas for potential collaborations, feel free to reach out! You can connect with me through GitHub or reach out via email at [shubhamjain0915@tamu.edu](mailto:shubhamjain0915@tamu.edu).
